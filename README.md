# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic Tac Toe project is a simple web-based game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the classic two-player game where players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with "X" or "O". The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
